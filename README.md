# Teiko Clinical Trial Analysis

A clinical trial dashboard built with FastAPI and React. Cell count data from a CSV gets loaded into a normalized SQLite database, statistical analysis runs against that database, and the results are served through an API to an interactive dashboard for exploring immune cell populations across patient cohorts.

**Dashboard:** http://localhost:5173

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+, Node 20+

```bash
make setup      # install Python and Node dependencies
make pipeline   # load data into SQLite and run analysis
make dashboard  # start API server + React dev server
```

**GitHub Codespaces:** both servers bind to `0.0.0.0` so the forwarded ports work without any extra configuration.

1. `make setup` installs Python packages from `requirements.txt` and runs `npm install` in `dashboard/`.
2. `make pipeline` runs `load_data.py` to create `clinical_data.db`, then `analysis.py` to generate summary tables and boxplots in `output/`.
3. `make dashboard` starts the FastAPI server on port 8000 and the Vite dev server on port 5173 concurrently.

## Database Schema

Three tables:

```
subjects     subject (PK), condition, age, sex
samples      sample (PK), subject (FK), project, sample_type,
             time_from_treatment_start, treatment, response
cell_counts  id (PK), sample (FK), population, count
```

### Design

**Treatment and response live on `samples`, not `subjects`.** A subject can have samples at multiple timepoints, across projects, under different treatments. Collapsing treatment and response onto the subject row loses that variation entirely. The Part 4 query - filter by condition, sample type, treatment, and timepoint simultaneously - can't be written correctly if those columns live on different tables. Keeping them on `samples` means every filter is a WHERE clause against one table.

**Cell counts are stored as rows, not columns.** The source CSV has one row per sample with five population columns. Keeping that structure means a schema migration every time a new population is added. As rows in `cell_counts`, adding a population is just new data.

**Foreign keys are enabled explicitly.** SQLite disables FK enforcement by default. The connection helper turns it on per connection so referential integrity is actually guaranteed, not assumed.

### Scaling

The three-table structure holds up well at scale. The joins in the boxplot and stats queries are straightforward lookups on primary keys. Adding indexes on `samples(condition, sample_type, treatment)` and `cell_counts(sample, population)` would cover the common filter patterns once row counts get large enough to matter. New populations don't require schema changes. New analytics - cut by project, timepoint, sex, or any combination - are new queries against the same three tables. If SQLite becomes a bottleneck at millions of rows, the queries are standard SQL and the migration path to Postgres is mostly a connection string swap.

## Code Structure

```
load_data.py        ingest CSV into SQLite (idempotent, safe to re-run)
analysis.py         Parts 2-4: frequency table, Mann-Whitney stats, boxplots
api.py              FastAPI endpoints serving JSON to the dashboard
src/
  db.py             schema definition and connection helper
  stats.py          statistical utility functions
dashboard/
  src/
    App.tsx         nav, dark mode, scroll tracking
    components/     DataTable, BoxplotSection, FilterBar, etc.
output/             generated CSV tables and PNG plots (from make pipeline)
```

The pipeline and the API are intentionally separate. `load_data.py` and `analysis.py` run once to build the database and write static outputs. The API reads from that database at request time. This separation allows the dashboard to support dynamic filtering (changing condition, treatment, or sample type) without re-computing the analysis.

The frontend has no business logic. All aggregation and statistical computation happens in the backend. The React components handle rendering and interaction; the API handles the numbers.

Data goes into SQLite rather than staying in memory because it keeps the API stateless. Each request opens a connection, runs a query, and closes it. Nothing persists between requests, which makes the API straightforward to reason about and test.

## Testing

**Backend** (pytest with coverage):
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing
```

**Frontend** (vitest with coverage):
```bash
cd dashboard && npm run test:coverage
```

- The backend achieves 100% coverage on `api.py`, `load_data.py`, and `src/db.py`.
- The frontend sits at 99.5% statements and 100% lines and functions across all components.
- CI runs on every push and pull request to `main` with GitHub Actions.
